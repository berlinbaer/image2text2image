The scene unfolds within a vast, sterile industrial facility where the ceiling is dominated by an array of evenly spaced fluorescent lights, their white rectangular panels casting sharp, cold illumination across the entire expanse. The floor below this grid-like structure serves as a flat platform for a series of artificial hills constructed from lush green grass that has been meticulously planted to mimic natural terrain. These mounds vary subtly in height and slope; some are gentle slopes with sparse shrubs clinging at the edges, while others rise steeply into small ridges dotted with tufts of wild vegetation.

In contrast to the surrounding concrete walls—smooth and unadorned—the ground itself feels alive yet contained, its texture appearing almost like velvet beneath the overhanging rooflines. A cluster of sheep, varying slightly in coloration—from pale cream to darker brown—with short wool coats and prominent horns wander freely through these verdant terrains. Their bodies are plump but lean, suggesting they may be young or recently fed. One goat stands near the foreground on what appears to be a shallow incline, facing toward the left side of the frame, whereas another grazes atop one of the higher peaks. Some animals seem more alert than others, perhaps wary of human presence implied by distant shadows cast under the overhead fixtures.

A few signs can be seen along the far wall—one marked "Hills" pointing upward—and faint blue markings indicate pathways leading up the hillside structures. There’s minimal movement among them except for occasional shifts in posture when grazing or moving between rises. The air seems still and clean despite the absence of wind noise; it's quiet enough not even to hear individual breaths. This silence adds weight to the atmosphere created here—a place designed to simulate nature without ever truly being so. 

From the viewer’s vantage point positioned just outside the main entrance, there is ample negative space around both sides of the image which enhances focus on the central activity occurring amidst these man-made features. The overall effect creates a striking juxtaposition: life growing organically inside something completely synthetic—an open-air farm enclosed within steel-reinforced architecture. Light filters down softly off every surface, highlighting subtle variations in shade and form throughout all elements shown. While visually harmonious due largely to consistent colors and repetitive shapes, each detail contributes uniquely to how we perceive reality versus illusion in such settings.
