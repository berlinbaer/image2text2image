A woman with short white hair stands at the far end of a long, dark conference table in an empty room. She wears a denim jacket over a patterned shirt, her hands clasped behind her back as she looks forward. The scene takes place inside a modern office or command center, featuring sleek black chairs arranged along both sides of the large rectangular table. Behind her are mirrored walls that reflect the same setup but show faint outlines of other figures standing further down the hall. Bright overhead fluorescent lights illuminate the ceiling from above while casting sharp reflections on the glossy surface of the floor below where green carpeting runs parallel to the edge of the room's perimeter. A single source light emits bright white illumination across several panels embedded into the ceiling structure which creates strong contrast against the surrounding darkness. The space appears minimalistic yet imposing due to its length and symmetry—this wide-angle shot captures most of this expanse through low perspective looking slightly upward toward the high ceilings and glowing fixtures. This arrangement emphasizes scale and emptiness within the setting. There’s no direct indication about any specific person beyond those already described—the focus remains solely on the solitary figure positioned centrally under intense artificial glow amidst rows of unoccupied seating.
