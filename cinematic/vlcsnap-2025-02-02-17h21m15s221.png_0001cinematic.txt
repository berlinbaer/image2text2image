A vast, sterile room stretches into the distance, its ceiling lined with rows of bright, square fluorescent fixtures that cast an even, clinical light across the space. The walls are smooth white panels, reflecting the overhead glow without adding warmth or texture. In this artificial enclosure, green hills rise in gentle terraces—grass-covered mounds that form natural slopes within the structure’s confines. A flock of goats, their coats ranging from creamy beige to pale gray, moves through these verdant elevations as if they were part of a pastoral landscape. Some graze quietly on lower levels while others pause at the cresting edges where shadows fall deeper than the illumination above. Their heads lift occasionally toward the sky, yet there is nothing about them suggesting freedom—they remain tethered by unseen lines to some distant purpose. This irony contrasts sharply with the surrounding emptiness: only the goat's movement breaks the monotony of uniformity, each animal contributing subtly to the rhythm of life suspended between reality and illusion. From a wide-angle perspective taken slightly off-center, the viewer feels enveloped by scale—the sheer size of the building making one realize how small individual beings can appear when placed against such grandeur. Depth of field keeps both foreground and background elements sharp, emphasizing not just detail but also spatial coherence. There’s a quiet tension here: nature reimagined indoors under controlled conditions. It evokes questions of ethics and control, inviting contemplation over what kind of world we create for animals—or perhaps whether any place truly belongs to us all. The air hums faintly beneath the surface, echoing softly behind every step along those grassy paths.
