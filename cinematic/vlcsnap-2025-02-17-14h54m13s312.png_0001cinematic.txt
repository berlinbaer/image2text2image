The graveyard sprawls across a windswept hillside overlooking a vast, dark sea under an oppressive grey sky. The weather is unsettled—clouds press down with thick, bruised weight, casting long shadows over every stone and headstone in this ancient cemetery. A lone figure stands near the center-right, dressed in black, dwarfed by the scale of the tombstones that rise from grassy earth. In the distance, a small stone chapel rises on its own patch of land, surrounded by more graves and topped with a simple bell tower. To the left, several crosses point toward the horizon where waves crash against cliffs below. The foreground features numerous gravestones—a mix of ornate Celtic cross designs and plain rectangular slabs covered in moss or soot-like stains—and scattered trees, including one gnarled tree whose branches reach out as if trying to touch something unseen above.

As light filters through gaps in the clouds, creating patches of brighter illumination amid deepening gloom, each element seems both timeless and fragile at once. It evokes feelings of solitude, reverence, and enduring memory within nature’s relentless cycle.

Each grave bears witness to lives past, their presence etched into rock faces and mortar joints alike. Yet despite all signs of age, nothing has truly changed since those who first laid them to rest. With subtle shifts in focus—from sharp details on individual markers to soft blurings around edges—we follow how time reshapes everything slowly until only echoes remain. This place thrives on emptiness too—it invites contemplation rather than comfort. Its grandeur lies less in numbers and more in absence: empty spaces filled with grief, faith, love...all hidden behind silent walls carved centuries ago. And though many eyes may pass upon such scenes today, none ever fully understand why certain tombs stay untouched, some others fall away without trace. For most
