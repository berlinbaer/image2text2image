prompt: Hyper-realistic photographic portrait of a white woman with short white hair and striking angular features centered in frame, captured against a clean, neutral studio background. The image features a precise in-camera multiple exposure effect, creating three slightly offset silhouettes aligned horizontally. Each exposure is illuminated by a different colored light source: one deep cyan, one neutral white, and one soft crimson red, producing a clean RGB separation without blur or distortion.

Lighting is crisp and studio-driven: hard directional key lights placed symmetrically to create sharp edge definition, combined with controlled color gels to produce clean color overlays. The shadows remain soft and realistic, with no harsh clipping, maintaining photographic integrity. The overlap areas show accurate additive color mixing, with smooth transitions and realistic light physics rather than digital smearing.

The vibe is modern, graphic, and experimental while remaining grounded in professional portrait photography. Skin tones remain natural beneath the color layers, with realistic texture, pores, and tonal variation preserved. Shot with a 50mm lens, medium aperture for clarity, perfectly balanced exposure, neutral contrast curve, editorial portrait style, ultra-high resolution, hyper-realistic photographic quality, no illustration, no stylization.
