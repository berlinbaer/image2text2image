prompt: Hyper-realistic side-profile portrait of a white woman with short bleached hair and striking angular features in a dark, minimal environment, positioned in front of a large, perfectly circular orange light source that fills most of the background. The subject is in three-quarter profile facing left, with the circular light acting as a bold backdrop rather than direct illumination. Strong teal-blue key light comes from camera-left, cutting sharply across the face and neck, creating a clean silhouette and defined edge lighting. Shadows fall quickly into deep blacks, producing high contrast and a moody, graphic look. A faint warm bounce from the orange background subtly outlines the jaw and shoulder edges. Shot on an 85mm lens, tight framing from chest up, shallow depth of field with the background disc slightly softened but clearly defined. Camera placed at eye level, profile composition with negative space in front of the subject. Clean studio photography, crisp edges, realistic light falloff, no artistic stylization.
