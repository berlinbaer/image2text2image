prompt: Hyper-realistic studio portrait of a pale woman with short black hair and striking angular features centered in frame, facing forward, captured through a vertically rippled translucent surface that distorts and refracts light. Warm golden and amber light floods the scene, creating liquid-like caustic patterns across the face and upper torso, with highlights shimmering like reflected sunlight on water. Background is a solid saturated yellow, evenly lit but slightly darker toward the edges for subtle vignette. Lighting is directional from camera-left at a shallow angle, producing strong contrast between illuminated and shadowed halves of the face, with specular highlights stretched and broken by the textured surface in front of the lens. Secondary fill light is minimal, allowing deep shadows on camera-right. Shot on an 85mm portrait lens, tight close-up framing from shoulders up, shallow depth of field with the distortion plane in sharp focus and the subject just slightly behind it. Camera positioned straight-on at eye level, creating a symmetrical, graphic composition. Ultra-high detail, realistic skin light interaction, optical refraction, studio photography, no stylization.
