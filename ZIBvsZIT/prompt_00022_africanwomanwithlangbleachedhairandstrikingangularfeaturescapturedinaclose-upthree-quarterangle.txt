prompt: A hyper-realistic photographic portrait of a african woman with lang bleached hair and striking angular features captured in a close-up three-quarter angle, facing slightly to the right. He wears a sleek, wraparound translucent visor in vivid orange tones, covering the eyes and extending toward the temples. The visor appears in motion, creating horizontal light streaks and subtle motion blur trails across the frame, while the face beneath remains partially sharp. Clothing is dark and minimal, likely a high-collar technical garment, blending into the background.

Lighting is cinematic and directional, with a cool ambient base light and warm highlights interacting with the visor. A soft key light illuminates the face from camera-right, while the visor catches glowing reflections and streaks of orange light. Motion blur is intentional and optical, not painterly, suggesting a slow shutter or controlled movement during exposure. Background is cool-toned, softly blurred, and abstract, enhancing the sense of speed and futurism.

Camera is positioned close and slightly below eye level, using a short telephoto lens (70mm–85mm equivalent). Depth of field is shallow, with selective focus emphasizing the face while motion streaks remain dynamic and fluid. High-end editorial sci-fi photography aesthetic, ultra-sharp skin texture where visible, realistic reflections, modern color science, and professional cinematic realism.
