prompt: A hyper-realistic side-profile portrait of a white woman with medium ginger hair and striking angular features wearing a futuristic helmet with a smooth, opaque white shell and a clear curved visor extending forward. The helmet features subtle embedded hardware details and glossy black internal components visible through transparent sections. The white woman with medium ginger hair and striking angular features wears a minimal, dark, form-fitting garment with a matte finish. Background is pure black, absorbing light and creating strong contrast. Lighting is precise and controlled: a narrow softbox key light from the front-left highlights the visor curvature and helmet edges, while a faint rim light from behind outlines the helmet silhouette. Reflections on the visor are clean and intentional, with no clutter. Camera is positioned at head height, perfectly side-on, using a longer focal length (around 100mm equivalent) to flatten perspective and emphasize clean lines. Depth of field is shallow, keeping the helmet and face plane in sharp focus while the rear fades smoothly. Color palette is monochrome and cool, with a clinical, high-tech mood.
