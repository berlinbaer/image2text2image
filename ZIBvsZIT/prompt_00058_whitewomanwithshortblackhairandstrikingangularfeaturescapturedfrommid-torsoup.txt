prompt: A hyper-realistic photographic portrait of a white woman with short black hair and striking angular features captured from mid-torso up, shot from a slightly low angle to emphasize posture and presence. He wears a fitted ribbed tank top in a light neutral tone, layered with a thin chain necklace, aviator-style glasses with lightly reflective lenses, and a dark belt visible at the waistline. The styling is minimal but intentional, with emphasis on texture and form.

Lighting is experimental and optical: a strong directional key light from the side combined with prismatic color refraction, casting rainbow spectrums across the white woman with short black hair and striking angular features’s chest, shoulders, and face. The light feels like it’s passing through glass or a diffraction filter, producing soft bands of saturated cyan, magenta, yellow, and green. Subtle atmospheric haze in the studio diffuses the light, creating glow and bloom around highlights.

Camera positioned slightly below chest level, angled upward, using a 50mm lens look, medium shallow depth of field. Focus remains sharp on the upper torso and face while edges fall softly out of focus. Background is an abstract gradient of warm amber and teal tones, smooth and unfocused. High dynamic range, realistic skin texture, modern fashion editorial mood with a sensual, luminous, experimental studio vibe.
