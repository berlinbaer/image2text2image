prompt: A hyper-realistic photographic portrait of a african woman with short ginger hair and striking angular features in profile, facing left, wearing a futuristic protective helmet with a smooth off-white shell, integrated breathing apparatus, and translucent visor with a warm orange tint. Bright orange straps and fastening elements wrap around the helmet, adding contrast and industrial detail. The african woman with short ginger hair and striking angular features wears a dark, matte technical jacket with subtle paneling and shoulder straps, suggesting utilitarian or tactical design. Overall aesthetic is minimalist sci-fi with fashion editorial restraint.

Lighting is soft, diffused, and evenly wrapped, resembling an overcast outdoor or large softbox studio setup. Key light comes from camera-left, gently illuminating the helmet and visor without harsh reflections. Shadows are soft and controlled, with low contrast and smooth tonal transitions. Background is a pale, desaturated neutral tone, slightly greenish-gray, completely uncluttered.

Camera is positioned at head height in a clean side-profile composition, using a standard to short telephoto lens (50mm–70mm equivalent). Depth of field is shallow but not extreme, keeping the helmet and face area crisp while the background remains softly blurred. Color grading is muted and modern, emphasizing off-white, charcoal black, and orange accents. Ultra-clean, high-resolution fashion photography realism.
