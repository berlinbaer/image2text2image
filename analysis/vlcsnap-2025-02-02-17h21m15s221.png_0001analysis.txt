Subject: The image features a large indoor space with several goats grazing on grassy hills and mounds within the room.

People (if any): Not visible.

Environment: The setting appears to be an expansive, modern building interior with white walls, a high ceiling lined with fluorescent lights, and artificial greenery covering raised ground areas resembling small mountains or meadows.

Lighting: Bright overhead lighting from rectangular fixtures illuminates the entire area evenly without harsh shadows.

Camera/Composition: The camera captures a wide-angle view that emphasizes the scale of the enclosure and the distribution of animals across various levels of terrain inside the structure.

Color/Texture: Predominantly shades of green for the vegetation contrast against neutral whites and grays in the surrounding structures. Textures include smooth surfaces of wall panels, roughness of grass blades, and varied fur textures among the sheep.
