Lighting: Warm golden light from the setting sun illuminates the sky above the horizon, casting soft hues across the clouds and reflecting on the surface of the river.

Camera/Composition: Taken from an elevated vantage point, likely high up in a tower or building, offering a wide-angle perspective that captures the entire urban landscape along with its natural elements like the Thames River.
